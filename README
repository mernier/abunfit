| 		PROGRAM: abunfit.py
|
|
| 		SYNOPSIS: python abunfit.py [input_file] [number_of_models] [alpha] [SNe_model_1] [SNe_model_2] ... (--disable-plot) 
|
|
| 		DESCRIPTION: Fits a set of intra-cluster abundances with a combination of 
| 		             supernovae (SNe) yields models. Several models (either SNcc or SNIa) are available 
| 		             and can be updated or created.
|
|
| 		REQUIREMENTS: To run abunfit properly, you need Python 3 installed as well as the following
| 		              python libraries: os, sys, math, numpy, scipy, and matplotlib
|
|
| 		ARGUMENTS: 
|
| 		        [input_file] -- (Location of the) Text input file of the set of measured  
| 		                        ICM abundances. This file must contain 3 columns:  
| 		                        (1) the element number (Z), 
| 		                        (2) the measured abundance, and 
| 		                        (3) its associated (symmetrical) uncertainties.
|
| 		        [number_of_models] -- Integer indicating the number of models to
|  			                       be fitted simultaneously (min: 1, max: 4).
|
| 		        [alpha] -- Slope index of the assumed initial mass function (IMF). 
| 		                   Ex: for Salpeter IMF, alpha = -2.35.
|
| 		        [model<1/2/...>] -- Name of the model. Currently available models:

--------------------------

	1) SUB-DIRECTORIES
	------------------

		- data/		Contains the X/Fe measured abundance ratios in the intracluster medium from 
				various studies. For more information, see: 
				- de Plaa, J., Werner, N., Bleeker, J. A. M. et al., 2007, A&A, 465, 345
				- Mernier, F., de Plaa, J., Pinto, C. et al., 2016a, A&A, 592, A157

				- Simionescu, A., Nakashima, S., Yamaguchi, Y. et al., 2018, MNRAS, submitted
				- Mernier, F., Werner, N., de Plaa, J. et al., 2018b, MNRAS, 480, L95
				
		- solar_tables/		Contains the solar abundance reference tables taken from the 
				literature :
				- angr89.txt (Anders, E. & Grevesse, N., 1989, Geoch. et Cosmoch. Acta,  53, 197)
				- lodders09.txt (Lodders, K., Palme, H. & Geil, H. P., Landolt-Börnstein, 560)

		- SNcc/		Contains the predicted yields from SNcc contributions (Heger & Woosley 2002, 
				2010, Chieffi & Limongi 2004, Nomoto et al. 2006, Romano et al. 2010, 
				Nomoto et al. 2013, Sukhbold et al. 2016). 
				Compared to Nomoto et al. (2006), the Nomoto et al. (2013) yields contain an 
				addditional model of initial metallicity of Z=0.008, as well as slightly updated 
				calculations (e.g. taking into account the full decay of some unstable isotopes). 
				The models of Nomoto et al. (2006) have also been corrected from the full decay 
				of unstable isotopes. The models N20 and W18 of Sukhbold et al. (2016) include 
				neutrino transport and are calibrated to the explosion of SN1987A. In abunfit.py, 
				all these SNcc yields are IMF-integrated (with an IMF slope selected by the user) 
				from 10 M_sun to ~40 M_sun, if the initial metallicity Z>0. For the Nomoto Z=0 
				models, the integration covers up to 140 M_sun. The Z=0 yields from Heger & 
				Woosley (2002,2010) and Nomoto et al. (2013) are also predicted for pair-
				instability supernovae (PISNe, typically for >140 M_sun). A complete integration 
				over the full mass range (SNcc+PISNe) is also proposed ("_SNe" suffix). The 
				yields from Nomoto et al. (2013) are also predicted for hypernovae (HNe). In some 
				cases, the original SNcc models included unstable istopoes, which would later 
				decay into stable one, hence changing the final yields. These models have been 
				re-calculated once these istopes are fully decayed. The original models can be 
				found under the "_undecayed" suffix. Note that the models from Romano et al. (2010) 
				are pre-integrated assuming a Salpeter IMF. Changing the IMF slope in the command 
				line will result in no changes.

		- SNIa/		Contains the predicted yields from SNIa contributions (Iwamoto et al. 1999, 
				Badenes et al. 2006, Maeda et al. 2010, Pakmor et al. 2010, Sim et al. 2010, 
				Waldman et al. 2011, Sim et al. 2012, Kromer et al. 2013, Seitenzahl et al. 
				2013, Fink et al. 2014, Ohlmann et al. 2014, Marquardt et al. 2015, Kromer 
				et al. 2015, Seitenzahl et al. 2016, Leung & Nomoto 2018, Shen et al. 2018). 
				The (1D) Iwamoto et al. (1999, incl. deflagration and delayed-detonation) yields 
				are the most widely used in the literature, although somewhat outdated. The (1D) 
				Badenes et al. (2006) yields are based on delayed-detonation models that fit well 
				the spectral features of the Tycho supernova. The Maeda et al. (2010) yields 
				contain 2D deflagration and delayed detonation models, as well as an updated 
				version of the 1D Iwamoto et al. (1999) W7 yields (including more realistic 
				calculations of the electron capture rates). The Seitenzahl et al. (2013, 
				delayed-detonation) and Fink et al. (2014, deflagration) yields are the most 
				recent ones, and are modelled for 3D explosions. The Waldman et al. (2011) 
				yields are to be used in the case of Ca-rich gap transients. The Pakmor et al. 
				(2010,2012) and Kromer et al. (2013) yields are predictions for the 
				sub_Chandrasekhar channel, assuming a violent merger between two white dwarfs 
				(as part of the double-degenerate scenario). The yields of Shen et al. (2018) 
				are for a dynamically-driven double-degenerate double-detonation (DDDDDD) SNIa. 
				Like for SNcc, some of these models can be found in their original "undecayed" 
				version.

		- AGB/		Contains the predicted yields from AGB contributions (Nomoto et al. 2013; 
				adapted from Karakas 2010). All the AGB yields are IMF-integrated following the 
				same IMF slope as defined for SNcc. If necessary, the user can set another slope 
				in abunfit.py, specifically for AGB models. Note that the AGB contribution used 
				in abunfit.py has not been tested extensively. Use it at your own risk!


	2) FILES
	--------

		- abunfit.py	Main routine described above. To make it run, you need python, as well as the 
				libraries os, sys, math, numpy, scipy, and matplotlib. 

				The input files are:
				- A list of the measured X/Fe abundance ratios (found in cluster/, or of 
				  similar format). Note that the script is not (yet) suitable for absolute (X) 
				  abundance measurements. 
				- One, two, three, or four input yield models, as those described above (to be 
				  selected from models.txt). The format of these file depend on the type of 
				  model (SNIa or SNcc).
				- A reference (solar or proto-solar) abundance table. Here we use 
				  lodders09.txt, i.e. the proto-solar values of Lodders et al. (2009).
				- A table containing the atomic mass of each element (atomic_masses.txt).

				The static parameters (which can be changed in abunfit.py) are:
				- plotting_mode: If True, a plot of the measurements and the best-fit models is 
				  displayed. Moreover, the plot is saved in fig_output.pdf. It may be useful to 
				  set plotting_mode = False when the user wants to use abunfit.py multiple times 
				  (for example when using serial_fitter.sh, see below).
				- default_color_[SNIa/SNcc/AGB]: If plotting_mode = True, these parameters set 
				  the default color for each type of models.
				- alpha_SNcc_equiv_AGB: If True, the IMF-integration of the AGB yields will be 
				  calculated following the same slope as defined in the command line (i.e. as for 
				  SNcc models).
				- alpha_AGB: If alpha_SNcc_equiv_AGB = False, the slope of the IMF needed for 
				  integrating the AGB yields can be set via this parameter. 
				- abun_table: Defines the abundance table used for the calculations. So far, only 
				  the reference table of Lodders et al. (2009) is available, however the user is 
				  welcome to use their own table. Please refer to lodders09.txt for an example of 
				  the structure of the file.

				The output files are:
				- fig_output.pdf: If plotting_mode = True, a PDF version of the plot is saved 
				  under this file name.
				- output.qdp: A text file separating the measured ratios and the different 
				  contributions expected from each model. Columns, 1 and 2 show the element 
				  number and its error (by definition: 0). Column 3 shows the predicted or the 
				  measured X/Fe ratio. For the measurements, column 4 shows the associated 
				  errors. This file is optimized to be read by QDP 
				  (https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/lheasoft/ftools/others/qdp/qdp.html) and 
				  displayed in a simple graph.
				/!\ Each new run of abunfit.py will overwrite the pre-exisiting output files!

		- serial_fitter.sh	Bash script running a series of abundance fits (abunfit.py) with 
					various yield models and/or IMF slopes. All the tested combinations 
					are then folded by increasing chi^2 (via the routine 
					sort_fitting_results.py) into fitting_results_sorted.txt.
